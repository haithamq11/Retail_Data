# Retail_Data


A Machine Learning project for retail data analytics as part of the Machine Learning Engineering Nanodegree Capstone Project from Udacity. The project is inspired by the Kaggle challenge on https://www.kaggle.com/manjeetsingh/retaildataset where also the used data can be downloaded.


# Problem Statement


The goal is to predict the department wide sales for each store for the following year. This should then help to optimize the manufacturing process and therefore to increase income while lowering costs. It should be possible to feed in past sales data from a department and to get the predicted sales for the following year.
